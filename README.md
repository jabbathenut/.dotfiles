# Jabba's Neovim-based C/C++ Development Environment Dotfiles (MacOS)

This is my personal repository of configuration files for a Neovim-based C/C++
development environment. While it works well for me and my workflow, it may not
be what you expect or prefer. Please use this configuration with that in mind.

Download to your home folder (i.e. ~/.dotfiles). Then install with GNU Stow:

```zsh
cd ~/.dotfiles
stow .
```

## Notable Components

### Neovim C/C++ Development Environment

This configuration requires Neovim >= 0.11.

#### Dependencies

Installation uses Homebrew, unless otherwise indicated:

- Neovim

  ```zsh
  brew install neovim
  ```

  ```zsh
  brew install --cask font-jetbrains-mono-nerd-font
  ```

- CMake

  ```zsh
  brew install cmake
  ```

- Git

  ```zsh
  brew install git
  ```

- CCLS - C/C++ LSP (Install this only if using CCLS instead of Clangd)

  ```zsh
  brew install ccls
  ```

- Node.js and NPM

  ```zsh
  brew install node
  ```

- Ripgrep

#### LSPs

The LSP configurations are stored in the ~/.config/nvim/lsp directory.
Configurations located this directory are loaded automatically by Neovim. This
feature was implemented in Neovim 0.11. These loaded configurations are then
enabled and enhanced in the ~/.config/nvim/lua/config/lspconfig.lua file.

- clangd
- cmake-language-server (aka cmake)
- lua-language-server (aka luals)
- marksman

#### Formatters/Linters

- clang-format
- cmakelang (includes cmake-format)
- markdownlint-cli2
- prettierd
- stylua

#### LSP-Related Plugins

- mason.nvim
- mason-tool-installer.nvim
- blink.cmp (completion)
- conform.nvim (formatting)
- nvim-lint (linting)

#### Quality of Life Plugins

There are several QOL plugins that are not listed here, as they will likely
change frequently. They can, however, be easily identified in the
~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins directory.
